STARLINERS-HACKSLASH-WEB-DEVELOPMENT
This repository is created for the tasks and projects that are done by the community of hacslash team called 'STARLINERS'.
This repository contains all the learning through via tasks and minor and major projects.
The team is still learning the basics of web development like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
We hope to take this learning to advance level and create something amazing in our upcoming internal hackathon.
